The database loan.db consists of 5 tables: 
   1. customers - table containing customer data
   2. loans - table containing loan data pertaining to customers
   3. credit - table containing credit and creditscore data pertaining to customers
   4. repayments - table containing loan repayment data pertaining to customers
   5. months - table containing month name and month ID data
    
You are required to make use of your knowledge in SQL to query the database object (saved as loan.db) and return the requested information.
